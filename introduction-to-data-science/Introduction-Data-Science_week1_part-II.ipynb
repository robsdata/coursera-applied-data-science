    "#### **Handling Dates and Times in Python: A Comprehensive Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, dates and times are essential components. Whether you're calculating averages, mining data, or tracking activity trends, a strong grasp of date and time manipulation in Python is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storing Dates and Times:** Dates and times can be stored in various formats. In online transaction systems, one common method is based on the offset from the epoch, which is January 1, 1970. Although this approach may seem cryptic, it's not uncommon to encounter systems that store timestamps as seconds or milliseconds since this epoch. Converting these values is essential to make sense of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python's `datetime` Module:** Python provides a powerful tool for working with dates and times through the `datetime` module. This module allows you to obtain the current time since the epoch and create detailed timestamps, including year, month, day, and more. It's a versatile toolkit for date and time manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utilizing `datetime` Attributes:** The `datetime` object offers numerous attributes for extracting specific information such as hours, days, and seconds. These attributes provide granular control over date and time data, making it easier to perform a wide range of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performing Calculations with Time Deltas:** One of Python's strengths lies in its ability to handle time deltas. You can easily perform arithmetic operations with time deltas, enabling tasks like creating sliding windows for data analysis. For instance, you can identify periods of peak sales activity within a five-day span for further investigation.\n",
