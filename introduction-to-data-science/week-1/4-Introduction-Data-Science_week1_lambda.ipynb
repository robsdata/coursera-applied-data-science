While lambdas are perfect for creating short-lived anonymous functions, list comprehensions provide an efficient and readable way to generate lists.\n",

    "These advanced tools are commonly used in data science, and by mastering them, you'll be better equipped to work with Python in various programming tasks. While you're not required to use them in assignments, they are valuable additions to your Python programming toolkit. So go ahead and explore their capabilities to enhance your Python coding skills."

    "#### **Lambda Functions: Creating Anonymous Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are Python's way of creating anonymous functions—functions without a name. These functions are typically short-lived and straightforward, making it more convenient to write them in a single line rather than defining a named function. The lambda syntax is relatively simple but may take some getting used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how lambda functions work:\n",
    "\n",
    "You declare a lambda function with the **lambda** keyword, followed by a list of arguments, a colon, and a single expression.\n",
    "Lambda functions have only one expression to be evaluated, and the result of this expression is returned when you execute the lambda.\n",
    "Consider this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z\n",
    "result = my_function(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a lambda's return value is a function reference, so you can execute the lambda and pass in different parameters as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that lambda functions have limitations. You cannot assign default values to lambda parameters, and complex logic isn't feasible inside a lambda because you're constrained to a single expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their limitations, lambdas are incredibly useful for simple data cleaning tasks and can be found in many examples online."

    "#### **List Comprehensions: A Concise Way to Create Lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions offer a concise way to generate lists in Python. They are a syntactic construct for creating a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable, such as a list, tuple, or range. \n",
    "The basic syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of list comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You specify the expression to calculate values in the new list.\n",
    "- You iterate over each item in the iterable.\n",
    "- An optional if clause allows you to filter items based on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = [x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [4, 16]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used a list comprehension to create a new list, squared, containing the squares of even numbers from the numbers list.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can also be used to create sets and dictionaries in a similar concise manner."
